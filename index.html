						An AR application which simulates a basketball training scene to improve shooting accuracy training efficiency.
						<br>

						Teenagers are now getting extra help in basketball training.

						Food App to check your items
						<br><br>
						People always forget what they bought from the supermarket, and it will cause the food spoil. If the cashier can scan the item’s qrcode and send the information to the users account, then users can know what they bought and when is the food expired day from their smart phone.
						<br><br>
						I built this app by Java and PHP. The cashier can use the scaner website to upload the item’s data to users’ mySQL database. For the users, they can check the items from Java app.

						Robotic Guide Dog
					</h1>
					<p class = "dedcripe">
						Robotic guide dog which can guide and assert the people with vision impairment. The user can voice  or joystick control the robot. And, the robot have these 3 functions 1. GPS navigation(it can guide user to the destination where the user commands) 2. Obstruction avoidance 3. Intelligent personal assistan(answer the question like the weather, times, and set alarm, etc)
						<br>
						<br>
						I developed this robot by Raspberry and sensors such as microphone, GPS module, and ultrasonic sensor,etc. The users can control the car by voice, and raspberry pi has a microphone to reccive the sound. Then, raspberry pi sends the sound file to OLAMI Website to do NLP. After getting the results, it will analzye and response to user.

						Carrot Top
					</h1>

					
									
					<p class = "describe">
						Using AR technique(HoloLens) to tell people when to harvest 
						<br><br>
						n the 48 hour-long AT&T AR/VR hackathon, my team created an AR application CarrotTop for Microsoft HoloLens. CarrotTop used the built-in camera on HoloLens to detect and predict the length of the carrot that buried underground with the shape of the leaf. Combining the technique of image recognition and augmented reality, CarrotTop overlays a holographic on top of the real carrot to provide the optimal harvest information which helps the farmer or amateurs harvest the carrot at the right time.
