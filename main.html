			<p>Sorry that I can't be with you rn... but I just wanna say I miss you and wish you can wait for me to come back. 
			Idk what is perfect love... but all I know is that I like your smile I wanna bring you that everyday. No matter what 
			happenes this memory will almost be unforgettable to me, and I wish you will never forget about it, too. When you like someone,
			you wish to share your happiness. But when you fall in love, you also share your pain... I will call us love then, and I will like 
			to share my happiness and sadness with you, and you can more rely on me(you already did) No matter what happenes wish we will 
			never forget about how much we love each other. More than like you... I will always remember it:)
